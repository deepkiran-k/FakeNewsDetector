&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">I'm Norah O'Donnell and thank you for joining us for tonight's CBS News vice presidential debate.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">We want to welcome our viewers on CBS, on other networks here in the U.S. and around the world.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.12">We have a consequential night ahead, and our focus is the issues that matter to you, the voter.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">Let's introduce the candidates: Minnesota's democratic governor Tim Walz and Ohio's republican senator JD Vance.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">Tonight, meeting for the first time.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">I'm Margaret Brennan.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">In order to have a thoughtful and civil debate, these are the rules that both campaigns have agreed to.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">Questions will be directed at one candidate who will have two minutes to respond.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">The other candidate will be allowed two minutes for rebuttal.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">Then each candidate will get another minute to make further points, with an additional 1 minute each at the discretion of the moderator.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">The primary role of the moderators is to facilitate the debate between the candidates, enforce the rules, and provide the candidates with the opportunity to fact check claims made by each other.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.55">CBS News reserves the right to mute the candidates microphones to maintain decorum.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">We have not shared the questions or topics with the campaigns.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">The stage is set.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">Governor, Senator, thank you for joining us.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">Let's get started.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.46">Tonight, our country is facing several unfolding crises.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.53">The Middle East is on the brink of war.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.83">Americans are suffering from the catastrophic impact of Hurricane Helene and now a labor strike as 25,000 dock workers from Maine to Texas are picketing.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">We're going to begin tonight with the Middle East, Margaret.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">Thank you, Norah.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.71">Earlier today, Iran launched its largest attack yet on Israel.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">But that attack failed thanks to joint U.S. and Israeli defensive action.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.84">President Biden has deployed more than 40,000 U.S. military personnel and assets to that region over the past year to try to prevent a regional war.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.78">Iran is weakened, but the U.S. still considers it the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and it has drastically reduced the time it would take to develop a nuclear weapon.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.81">It is down now to one or two weeks time.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">Governor Walz, if you are the final voice in the situation room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">You have two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">Well, thank you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">And thank you for those joining at home tonight.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">Let's keep in mind where this started.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.89">October 7th, Hamas terrorists massacred over 1400 Israelis and took prisoners.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.54">Iran, or, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental, getting its hostages back, fundamental, and ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute, fundamental necessity for the United States to have the steady leadership there.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.60">You saw it experienced today, where, along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.06">But what's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">It's clear.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">A nearly 80 year old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">But it's not just that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">It's those that were closest to Donald Trump that understand how dangerous he is when the world is this dangerous.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">His Chief of Staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed humanity being he'd ever met.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.80">And both of his Secretaries of Defense and his national security advisors said he should be nowhere near the White House.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.70">Now, the person closest to them, to Donald Trump, said he's unfit for the highest office.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">That was Senator Vance.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together, understanding that our allies matter.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">And as the Vice President said today, is we will protect our forces and our allied forces, and there will be consequences.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">Governor, your time is up.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">Senator Vance, the same question, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">You have two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.11">So, Margaret, I want to answer the question.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">First of all, thanks, Governor.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">Thanks to CBS for hosting the debate.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.18">And thanks most importantly to the American people who are watching this evening and caring enough about this country to pay attention to this vice presidential debate.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.15">I want to answer the question, but I want to actually give an introduction to myself a little bit because I recognize a lot of Americans don't know who either one of us are.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">I was raised in a working class family.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">My mother required food assistance for periods of her life.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">My grandmother required Social Security help to raise me.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">And she raised me in part because my own mother struggled with addiction for a big chunk of my early life.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">I went to college on the GI bill after I enlisted in the Marine Corps and served in Iraq.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">And so I stand here asking to be your Vice President with extraordinary gratitude for this country, for the American dream that made it possible for me to live my dreams.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.12">And most importantly, I know that a lot of you are worried about the chaos in the world and the feeling that the American Dream is unattainable.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">I want to try to convince you tonight over the next 90 minutes that if we get better leadership in the White House, if we get Donald Trump back in the White House, the American Dream is going to be attainable once again.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.52">Now, to answer this particular question, we have to remember that as much as Governor Walz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">People were afraid of stepping out of line.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.81">Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">What do they use that money for?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.60">They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies and, God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.18">Now, you asked about a preemptive strike, Margaret, and I want to answer the question.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">And we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">Thank you, Senator.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">Governor Walz, do you care to respond to any of the allegations?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.57">Well, look, Donald Trump was in office.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.65">We'll sometimes hear a revisionist history, but when Donald Trump was in office, it was Donald Trump who... we had a coalition of nations that had boxed Iran's nuclear program in in the inability to advance it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">Donald Trump pulled that program and put nothing else in its place.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.72">So Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">And when Iran shot down an American aircraft in international airspace, Donald Trump tweeted, because that's the standard diplomacy of Donald Trump.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.72">And when Iranian missiles did fall near U.S. troops and they received traumatic brain injuries, Donald Trump wrote it off as headaches.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">Look, our allies understand that Donald Trump is fickle.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.11">He will go to whoever has the most flattery or where it makes sense to him.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">Steady leadership like you witnessed today, like you witnessed in April.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.63">Both Iranian attacks were repelled.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.08">Our coalition is strong, and we need the steady leadership that Kamala Harris is providing.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.79">Senator Vance, the U.S. did have a diplomatic deal with Iran to temporarily pause parts of its nuclear program, and President Trump did exit that deal.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.73">He recently said just five days ago, the U.S. must now make a diplomatic deal with Iran because the consequences are impossible.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">Did he make a mistake?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">You have 1 minute.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">Well, first of all, Margaret, diplomacy is not a dirty word, but I think that's something that Governor Walz just said is quite extraordinary.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.75">You, yourself, just said Iran is as close to a nuclear weapon today as they have ever been.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.63">And, Governor Walz, you blame Donald Trump, who has been the Vice President for the last three and a half years, and the answer is your running mate, not mine.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.47">Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">Now, we talk about the sequence of events that led us to where we are right now, and you can't ignore October the 7th, which I appreciate Governor Walz bringing up.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">But when did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.61">It was during the administration of Kamala Harris.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">So Governor Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.54">Donald Trump has already done it once before.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.09">Ask yourself at home, when, when was the last time?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">I'm 40 years old.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.67">When was the last time that an American President didn't have a major conflict, breakout?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.50">The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was President.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">Gentlemen, we have a lot to get to.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">Norah?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.15">Margaret, thank you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.65">Let's turn now to Hurricane Helene.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.55">The storm could become one of the deadliest on record.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.86">More than 160 people are dead and hundreds more are missing.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.74">Scientists say climate change makes these hurricanes larger, stronger and more deadly because of the historic rainfall.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_10 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.90">Senator Vance, according to CBS News polling, seven in ten Americans and more than 60% of Republicans under the age of 45 favor the U.S. taking steps to try and reduce climate change.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.48">Senator, what responsibility would the Trump administration have to try and reduce the impact of climate change?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">I'll give you two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">Sure.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.52">So first of all, let's start with the hurricane because it's an unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">I just saw today, actually, a photograph of two grandparents on a roof with a six year old child, and it was the last photograph ever taken of them because the roof collapsed and those innocent people lost their lives.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">And I'm sure Governor Walz joins me in saying our hearts go out to those innocent people, our prayers go out to them.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.46">And we want as robust and aggressive as a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.15">And then, of course, afterwards, to help the people in those communities rebuild.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">I mean, these are communities that I love, some of them I know very personally.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">In Appalachia, all across the Southeast, they need their government to do their job.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">And I commit that when Donald Trump is president again, the government will put the citizens of this country first when they suffer from a disaster.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">And Norah, you asked about climate change.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.10">I think this is a very important issue.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.61">Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.52">I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">We want the environment to be cleaner and safer, but one of the things that I've noticed some of our democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.50">This idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">Well, let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument, so we're not arguing about weird science.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">Let's just say that's true.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.09">Well, if you believe that, what would you, what would you want to do?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.53">The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">What have Kamala Harris's policies actually led to?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.55">More energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">When I say that, I mean the amount of carbon emissions they're doing per unit of economic output.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">So if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">And unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.47">Governor Walz, you have two minutes to respond.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">Well, we got close to an agreement because all those things are happening.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">Look, first of all, it is a horrific tragedy with this hurricane, and my heart goes out to the folks that are down there in contact with the Governors.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">I serve as co-chair of the council of governors as we work together on these emergency managements.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">Governors know no partisanship.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.57">They work together to... all of the Governors and the emergency responders are on the ground.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">Those happen on the front end.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">The federal government comes in, makes sure they're there, that we recover.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">But we're still in that phase where we need to make sure that they're staying there, staying focused.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">Now, look, coming back to the climate change issue, there's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.70">Senator Vance has said that there's a climate problem in the past, Donald Trump called it a hoax and then joked that these things would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.67">What we've seen out of the Harris administration now, the Biden Harris administration is, we've seen this investment, we've seen massive investments, the biggest in global history that we've seen in the Inflation Reduction Act, has created jobs all across the country.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.66">Two thousand in Jeffersonville, Ohio.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.45">Taking the EV technology that we invented and making it here.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.73">Two hundred thousand jobs across the country.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.81">The largest solar manufacturing plant in North America sits in Minnesota.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">But my farmers know climate change is real.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">They've seen 500 year droughts, 500 year floods, back to back.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">But what they're doing is adapting, and this has allowed them to tell me, "Look, I harvest corn, I harvest soybean, and I harvest wind."</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">We're also producing more clean energy.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">So the solution for us is to continue to move forward, that climate change is real.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">Reducing our impact is absolutely critical.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">But this is not a false choice.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">You can do that at the same time you're creating the jobs that we're seeing all across the country.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">That's exactly what this administration has done.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">And that's what absolutely makes sense.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">And then we start thinking about, "How do we mitigate these disasters?"</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">Thank you, Senator.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.14">I want to give you an opportunity to respond there.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.72">The Governor mentioned that President Trump has called climate change a hoax.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">Do you agree?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.52">Well, look, what the President has said is that if the Democrats, in particular, Kamala Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America, and that's not what they're doing.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">So clearly, Kamala Harris herself doesn't believe her own rhetoric on this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">If she did, she would actually agree with Donald Trump's energy policies.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">Now, something Governor Walz said, I think is important to touch upon, because when we talk about "clean energy," I think that's a slogan that often the Democrats will use here.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">I'm talking, of course, about the Democratic leadership.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.79">And the real issue is that if you're spending hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars of American taxpayer money on solar panels that are made in China, number one, you're going to make the economy dirtier.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.60">We should be making more of those solar panels here in the United States of America.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">We are.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">In Minnesota.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.75">Some of them are, Tim, but a lot of them are being made overseas in China, especially the components that go into those solar panels.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">So if you really want to make the environment cleaner, you've got to invest in more energy production.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.75">We haven't built a nuclear facility, I think one, in the past 40 years.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">Natural gas.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">We got to invest more in it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">Kamala Harris has done the opposite.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.57">That's raised energy prices and also meant that we're doing worse by the climate.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">Senator, your time is up.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">Governor, would you like to respond?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.70">Well, look, we're producing more natural gas than we ever have.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">There's no moratorium on that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">We're producing more oil.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">But the folks know, and my... like I said, again, these are not liberal folks.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">These are not folks that are green, new deal folks.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.59">These are farmers that have been, drought one year, massive flooding the next year.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">They understand that it makes sense.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.68">Look, our number one export cannot be topsoil from erosion from these massive storms.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.46">We saw it in Minnesota this summer.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.08">And thinking about, "How do we respond to that?"</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.48">we're thinking ahead on this and what Kamala Harris has been able to do in Minnesota, we're starting to weatherproof some of these things.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.66">The infrastructure law that was passed allows us to think about mitigation in the future.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">How do we make sure that we're protecting by burying our power lines?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">How do we make sure that we're protecting lakefronts and things that we're seeing more and more of.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.45">But to call it a hoax and to take the oil company executives to Mar-a-Lago, say, give me money for my campaign and I'll let you do whatever you want.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.15">We can be smarter about that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">And an all above energy policy is exactly what she's doing, creating those jobs right here.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">Governor, your time is up.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.64">The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the earth's climate is warming at an unprecedented rate.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">Margaret?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">Thank you, Norah.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">We're going to turn now to immigration.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.66">The crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border consistently ranks as one of the top issue for American voters.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.74">Senator Vance, your campaign is pledging to carry out the largest mass deportation plan in American history and to use the U.S. military to do so.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.10">Could you be more specific about exactly how this will work?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.55">For example, would you deport parents who have entered the U.S. illegally and separate them from any of their children who were born on U.S. soil?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">You have two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">So first of all, Margaret, before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.70">We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.71">Ninety-four executive orders suspending deportations, decriminalizing illegal aliens, massively increasing the asylum fraud that exists in our system, that has opened the floodgates.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.61">And what it's meant is that a lot of fentanyl is coming into our country.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">I had a mother who struggled with opioid addiction and has gotten clean.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.51">I don't want people who are struggling with addiction to be deprived of their second chance because Kamala Harris let in fentanyl into our communities at record levels.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">So you've got to stop the bleeding.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">You've got to re-implement Donald Trump's border policies, build the wall, re-implement deportations.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">And that gets me to your point, Margaret, about what do we actually do?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.86">So we've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.12">What do we do with them?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.84">About a million of those people have committed some form of crime in addition to crossing the border illegally.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">I think you start with deportations on those folks, and then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">And by the way, that'll be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">And the final point, Margaret, is you ask about family separation.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.88">Right now in this country, Margaret, we have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.65">Some of them have been sex trafficked, some of them hopefully are at homes with their families, some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.09">Real leadership would be saying, "You know what?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">I screwed up.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies."</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.08">I wish that she would do that, it would be good for all of us.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">Governor, do you care to respond to any of those specific allegations, including that the Vice President is, quote, "letting in fentanyl and using kids as drug mules, among other things..."</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">Yeah, well...</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">... regarding children?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">The drug mule is not true.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">But I will say about this, about the fentanyl, because this is a crisis of this, the opioid crisis.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.88">And the good news on this is the last twelve months saw the largest decrease in opioid deaths in our nation's history, 30% decrease in Ohio.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">But there's still more work to do.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">But let's go back to this on immigration.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.79">Kamala Harris was the Attorney General of the largest state and a border state in California.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.76">She's the only person in this race who prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drug interventions.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">But look, we all want to solve this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.47">Most of us want to solve this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">And that is the United States Congress.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.63">That's the Border Patrol Agents, that's the Chamber of Commerce.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">That's most Americans out here.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.75">That's why we had the fairest and the toughest bill on immigration that this nation's seen.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">It was crafted by a conservative senator from Oklahoma, James Lankford.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">I know him.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">He's super conservative, but he's a man of principle, wants to get it done.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.61">Democrats and Republicans worked on this piece of legislation.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.65">The Border Patrol said, this is what we need in here.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">These are the experts.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.74">And the Chamber of Commerce in the Wall Street Journal said, pass this thing.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.46">Kamala Harris helped get there.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.76">Fifteen hundred new border agents, detection for drugs, DOJ money to speed up these adjudications on this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">Just what America wants.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.65">But as soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this Donald Trump said "No," told them to vote against it because it gives him a campaign issue.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">It gives him, what would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">And they need to be done by the legislature.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">You can't just do this through the executive branch.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">So, look, we have the options to do this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.73">Donald Trump had four years.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.59">He had four years to do this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">And he promised you, America, how easy it would be.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">I'll build you a big, beautiful wall and Mexico will pay for it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.84">Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.50">But here we are again, nine years after he came down that escalator, dehumanizing people and telling them what he was going to do.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.62">As far as a deportation plan, at one point, Senator Vance said it was so unworkable as to be laughable.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">So that's where we're at.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">Pass the bill.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">She'll sign it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">Governor, your time is up.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">Senator, the question was, will you separate parents from their children, even if their kids are U.S. citizens?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">You have 1 minute.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.63">Margaret, my point is that we already have massive child separations thanks to Kamala Harris' open border.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">And I didn't accuse Kamala Harris of inviting drug mules, I said that she enabled the Mexican drug cartels to operate freely in this country, and we know that they use children as drug mules, and it is a disgrace and it has to stop.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">Look, I think what Tim said just doesn't pass the smell test.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.53">For three years, Kamala Harris went out bragging that she was going to undo Donald Trump's border policy.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.50">She did exactly that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.84">We had a record number of illegal crossings.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.89">We had a record number of fentanyl coming into our country.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">And now, now that she's running for President, or a few months before, she says that somehow she got religion and cared a lot about a piece of legislation.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.75">The only thing that she did when she became the Vice President, when she became the appointed border czar, was to undo 94 Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.85">Governor, what about our CBS News polling, which does show that a majority of Americans, more than 50%, support mass deportations?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">Look, we fix this issue with a bill that is necessary.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">But the issue on this is this is what happens when you don't want to solve it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">You demonize it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">And we saw this, and Senator Vance, and it surprises me on this, talking about and saying, "I will create stories to bring attention to this."</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.60">That vilified a large number of people who were here legally in the community of Springfield.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">The Republican Governor said, "It's not true.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">Don't do it."</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">There's consequences for this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">There's consequences.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">We could come together.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.50">Senator Lankford did it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">We could come together and solve this if we didn't let Donald Trump continue to make it an issue.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.78">And the consequences in Springfield were the Governor had to send state law enforcement to escort kindergarteners to school.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.48">I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">But by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.12">And when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D.

Vance: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">Look, Margaret, first of all, the gross majority of what we need to do at the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.53">I've been to the southern border more than our Borders are, Kamala Harris has been.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol Agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">Of course, additional resources would help.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.63">But most of this is about the President and the Vice President empowering our law enforcement to say, "If you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico, you've got to go back through proper channels."</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">Now, Governor Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">It is a disgrace, Tim.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.18">And I actually think, I agree with you.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.52">They helped craft it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">They're the ones that supported it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">It was... that's because they know we need to do this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.74">Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">I agree.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.54">It should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.76">This bill gets it done in 90 days.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.08">Then you start to make a difference in this and you start to adhere to what we know.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">American principles.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.18">I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about, "To the least amongst us, you do unto me."</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">I think that's true of most Americans.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">They simply want order to it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.51">This bill does it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.46">It's funded, it's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.83">Governor Walz, Vice President Harris unveiled a plan that includes billions in tax credits for manufacturing, housing and a renewed child tax credit.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.82">The Wharton School says your proposals will increase the nation's deficit by $1.2 trillion.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">How would you pay for that without ballooning the deficit?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">Governor, I'll give you two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">Yeah.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">Thank you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">And Kamala Harris and I do believe in the middle class because that's where we come from.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">We both grew up in that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">We understand.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">So those of you out there listening tonight, you're hearing a lot of stuff back and forth.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">And it's good.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">It's healthy.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">That's what this is supposed to happen.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">You should be listening.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.14">"How's this going to impact me?"</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.51">The bold forward plan that Kamala Harris put out there is, one, is talking about this housing issue.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.83">The one thing is there's 3 million new houses proposed under this plan with down payment assistance on the front end.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">To get you in a house.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">A house is much more than just an asset to be traded somewhere.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">It's foundational to where you're at.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">And then making sure that the things you buy every day, whether they be prescription drugs or other things, that there's fairness in that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.67">Look, the $35 insulin is a good thing, but it costs $5 to make insulin.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.78">They were charging $800 before this law went into effect.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.81">As far as the housing goes, I've seen it in Minnesota, 12% more houses in Minneapolis, prices went down on rent, 4%.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">It's working.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.57">And then making sure tax cuts go to the middle class, $6,000 child tax credit.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.75">We have one in Minnesota, reduces childhood poverty by a third.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.51">We save money in the long run and we do the right thing for families and then getting businesses off the ground.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.83">The law, as it stands right now, is $5,000 tax credit for small business, increasing that to $50,000.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.14">Now, this is a philosophical difference between us.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.18">Donald Trump made a promise, and I'll give you this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.50">He kept it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">He took folks to Mar-a-Lago.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.57">He said, "You're rich as hell.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">I'm going to give you a tax cut."</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.82">He gave the tax cuts that predominantly went to the top caste.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.88">What happened there was an $8 trillion increase in the national debt, the largest ever.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.80">Now he's proposing a 20% consumption or sales tax on everything we bring in.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">Everyone agrees, including businesses.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">It would be destabilizing it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.59">It would increase inflation and potentially lead to a recession.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">Look, this is simple for you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.18">Where are we going?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">Kamala Harris has said to do the things she wants to do.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">We'll just ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">When you do that, our system works best.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">More people are participating in it, and folks have the things that they need.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">Senator, I want to give you a moment to respond on that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.83">But similarly, the Wharton School has done an analysis of the Trump plan and says it would increase the nation's deficit by 5.8 trillion.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.12">My question is the same for you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">How do you pay for all that without ballooning the deficit?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">I'll give you two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">Well, first of all, you're going to hear a lot from Tim Walz this evening, and you just heard it in the answer, a lot of what Kamala Harris proposes to do.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">And some of it, I'll be honest with you, it even sounds pretty good.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">Here's what you won't hear, is that Kamala Harris has already done it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">Because she's been the Vice President for three and a half years, she had the opportunity to enact all of these great policies.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.72">And what she's actually done instead is drive the cost of food higher by 25%, drive the cost of housing higher by about 60%, open the American southern border and make middle class life unaffordable for a large number of Americans.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now, not when asking for a promotion, but in the job the American people gave her three and a half years ago.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">And the fact that she isn't, tells you a lot about how much you can trust her actual plans.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">Now, Donald Trump's economic plan is not just a plan, but it's also a record.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.78">A lot of those same economists attack Donald Trump's plans, and they have PhDs, but they don't have common sense and they don't have wisdom, because Donald Trump's economic policies delivered the highest take home pay in a generation in this country, 1.5% inflation, and to boot, peace and security all over the world.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.59">So when people say that Donald Trump's economic plan doesn't make sense, I say "Look at the record he delivered: rising take home pay for American workers."</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.62">Now, Tim admirably admits that they want to undo the Trump tax cuts.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.76">But if you look at what was so different about Donald Trump's tax cuts, even from previous Republican tax cut plans, is that a lot of those resources went to giving more take home pay to middle class and working class Americans.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.82">It was passed in 2017, and you saw an American economic boom unlike we've seen in a generation in this country.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.12">That is a record that I'm proud to run on and we're going to get back to that common sense wisdom so that you can afford to live the American Dream again.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">I know a lot of you are struggling.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">I know a lot of you are worried about paying the bills.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">It's going to stop when Donald Trump brings back common sense to this country.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">Governor, do you want to respond to that?</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.71">Yeah, well, Kamala Harris' day one was Donald Trump's failure on COVID that led to the collapse of our economy.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.79">We were already before COVID, in a manufacturing recession.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.87">But 10 million people out of work, largest percentage since the Great Depression, 9 million jobs closed on that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">That was day one.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.51">Whether it was the Infrastructure Act or other things, we moved.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.14">Now, you made a question about experts, said this, I made a note of this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">"Economists don't, can't be trusted.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">That's what's wrong with the system.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.11">There's a way around it.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">Town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.14">Passionate about it, a young teacher.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.45">My first year out, I got the opportunity in the summer of 89 to travel to China, 35 years ago, be able to do that.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">The issue for that was, was to try and learn.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">Now, look, my community knows who I am.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.09">I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.11">And I'm a knucklehead at times, but it's always been about that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.60">Those same people elected me to Congress for twelve years.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.46">And in Congress I was one of the most bipartisan people.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.59">Working on things like farm bills that we got done, working on veterans benefits.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">And then the people of Minnesota were able to elect me to governor twice.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">So look, my commitment has been from the beginning, to make sure that I'm there for the people, to make sure that I get this right.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.07">I will say more than anything, many times, I will talk a lot.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.12">I will get caught up in the rhetoric.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">I learned a lot about China.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">I hear the critiques of this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">I would make the case that Donald Trump should have come on one of those trips with us.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.11">So this is about trying to understand the world.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.09">It's about trying to do the best you can for your community, and then it's putting yourself out there and letting your folks understand what it is.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.09">My commitment, whether it be through teaching, which I was good at, or whether it was being a good soldier or was being a good member of Congress, those are the things that I think are the values that people care about.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">And, you know, I grew up in a working class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.12">And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.11">And I know she's watching tonight, and I love you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">And she told me something a couple years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">And I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable is that my party, we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American People's trust back on this issue where they frankly just don't trust us.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">I want us to support fertility treatments.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">I want it to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.69">Now, of course, Donald Trump has been very clear that on the abortion policy specifically, that we have a big country and it's diverse.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">And California has a different viewpoint on this than Georgia.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">Georgia has a different viewpoint from Arizona.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">And the proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions, let the individual states make their abortion policy.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.11">And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big, a very diverse, and let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">Well, let me tell you about this idea that there's diverse states.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">There's a young woman named Amber Thurmond.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">Amber Thurman died in that journey back and forth.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights as basic as the right to control your own body is determined on geography?</span> &nbsp;

Vance: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">I asked a specific question, Governor.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">And you gave me a slogan as a response.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">It's not the case.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">It's not true.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">That's not what the law says.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.78">So they fact checked it with President Trump.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">Gentlemen, there's a lot to discuss.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.15">We have to move on.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">And we're going to be right back with much more of the CBS News vice presidential debate in just a moment.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">Second Segment</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">Welcome back to the CBS News vice presidential debate.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.78">We want to turn now to America's gun violence epidemic, the leading cause of death for children and teens in America is by firearms.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.75">Senator Vance, you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.70">You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi automatic rifles, including AR-15s.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.12">So let me ask you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.80">Earlier this year, for the first time, the parents of a school shooter were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in prison.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">Do you think holding parents responsible could curb mass shootings?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">I'll give you two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">Yeah.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">Well, Norah, on that particular case, I don't know the full details, but I certainly trust local law enforcement and local authorities to make those decisions.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.12">I think in some cases the answer is going to be yes, and in some cases the answer is going to be no.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.15">And the details really matter here.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">Of course.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">For example, if a kid steals a gun, that's going to be different than if a parent hands over a gun knowing that their kid is potentially dangerous.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">Look, I want to just sort of speak as a father of three beautiful little kids, and our oldest is now in second grade.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.11">And like a lot of parents, we send our kids to school with such hope and such joy and such pride at their little faces on the first day of school.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.54">And we know, unfortunately, that a lot of kids are going to experience this terrible epidemic of gun violence.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">And of course, our hearts go out to the families that are affected by this terrible stuff.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.18">And we do have to do better.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">And I think that Governor Walz and I actually probably agree that we need to do better on this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.09">The question is just how do we actually do it?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">Now, here's something that really bothers me and worries me about this epidemic of violence.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.86">The gross majority, close to 90%, and some of the statistics I've seen of the gun violence in this country is committed with illegally obtained firearms.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.68">And while we're on that topic, we know that thanks to Kamala Harris's open border, we've seen a massive influx in the number of illegal guns run by the Mexican drug cartel.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_10 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.90">So that number, the amount of illegal guns in our country is higher today than it was three and a half years ago.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.06">But what do we do about the schools?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.14">What do we do to protect our kids?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">And I think the answer is, and I say this not loving the answer because I don't want my kids to go to school and a school that feels unsafe or where there are visible signs of security.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">But I unfortunately think that we have to increase security in our schools.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.14">We have to make the doors lock better.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">We have to make the doors stronger.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">We've got to make the windows stronger.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">And of course, we've got to increase school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.15">So we've got to make our schools safer, and I think we've got to have some common sense, bipartisan solutions for how to do that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">Governor, you have two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.15">Well, I think all the parents watching tonight, this is your biggest nightmare.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">'Cause I do think it illustrates some of the, frankly weird differences between our own country's gun violence problem and Finland is.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.63">Okay, first of all, we have way higher rates of mental health abuse or mental health substance abuse.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.46">We have way higher rates of depression, way higher rates of anxiety.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">We, unfortunately, have a mental health crisis in this country that I really do think that we need to get to the root causes of because I don't think it's the whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">But I do think it's a big piece of it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">Another driver of the gun violence epidemic, especially that affecting our kids.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.65">It doesn't earn as many headlines, but is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.54">And this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">I think there's a whole host of things that we can do here, but I do think at our schools, we've got to talk about more security.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">Why?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">Yeah.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">I've become friends with school shooters.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">I've seen it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">Look, the NRA.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">I was the NRA guy for a long time.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">They used to teach gun safety.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">I'm of an age where my shotgun was in my car so I could pheasant hunt after football practice.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">That's not where we live today.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">And several things I want to mention on this is talking about cities and where it's at.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.83">The number one, where the most firearm deaths happen in Minnesota are rural suicides.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.67">And we have an epidemic of children getting guns and shooting themselves.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.48">And so we have, and we should look at all of the issues, making sure folks have healthcare and all that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">But I want to be very careful.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">This idea of stigmatizing mental health, just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">Sometimes it just is the guns.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">It's just the guns.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">And there are things that you can do about it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.11">But I do think that this is one, and I think this is a healthy conversation.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">I think there's a capacity to find solutions on this that work, protect Second Amendment, protect our children.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.60">Let's turn now to the top contributor to inflation, the high cost of housing and rent.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.88">There's a shortage of more than 4 million homes in the United States and this contributes to the high housing crisis.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.76">Governor Walz, the Harris campaign promises a $25,000 down payment assistance for first time homebuyers and a $10,000 tax credit.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.70">They also promise to build 3 million new homes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">Where are you building these new homes and won't handing out that kind of money just drive up prices higher?</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">And I think those of you listening on this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.45">The problem we've had is that we've got a lot of folks that see housing as another commodity.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">It can be bought up.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">It can be shifted.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.45">It can be moved around.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.46">Those are not folks living in those houses.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">Those of you listening tonight, that house is a big deal.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.63">I bought and owned one house in my life.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">My mom still lives in the house where I was.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.11">And when I think of a house, I'm thinking of Christmas services after midnight Mass, where you go with your family.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">We need to make it more affordable.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">And one of the things, as I said, this program that the Vice President is pushing forward and bringing a new way of approaching.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.45">This is something we're doing in Minnesota from that lead.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.59">We in the state invested in making sure our housing was the biggest investment that we'd ever made in housing.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">It starts to make it easier.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">We cut some of the red tape.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">Local folks, look, we can't do at the Federal level, but local folks make it easier to build those homes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">And then that down payment assistance.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.64">I can tell all of you out there, one of the, certainly for me, using the GI bill was one thing, but a veteran's home loan, the big thing about a veteran's home loan is you don't have to pay the down payment.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">Those are things that make it there.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.53">Now, look, you're going to pay it back and you're going to pay your mortgage.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">Those are things that we know in the long run, the appreciated value, the generational wealth that's created from it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">And I will give Minneapolis an example.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.87">Minneapolis is the one city where we've seen the lowest inflation rates.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.88">We've seen a 12% increase in stock because we put some of these things in.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.71">And we're implementing a state program to make sure we give some of that down payment assistance.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">We get it back from people, because here's what we know.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">Where are you going to build all the new homes you're promising?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">And what part of any of this plan will provide immediate relief?</span> &nbsp;

Vance: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.77">Well, what Donald Trump has said is we have a lot of federal lands that aren't being used for anything.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.60">They're not being used for national parks.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.64">They're not being used.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">And they could be places where we build a lot of housing.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">And I do think that we should be opening up building in this country.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">We have a lot of land that could be used.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">We have a lot of Americans that need homes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.52">We should be kicking out illegal immigrants who are competing for those homes, and we should be building more homes for the American citizens who deserve to be here.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">I guess we agreed not to fact check.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">I'll check it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.76">That, look, crossings are down compared to when Donald Trump left office.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">But it's, again, blaming and not trying to find the solution.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">I was going to ask, though, on this question, are we going to drill and build houses in the same federal land.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">And I think when people hear federal lands, these are really important pieces of land.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.74">Now, Minnesota doesn't have a lot of federal lands.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">I know in the western part of the countries we do.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.71">There's not a lot of federal lands in and around Minneapolis, for example.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">So the issue is, I don't understand the federal lands issue unless we see this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">And I worry about this as someone who cares deeply about our national parks and our federal lands.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">Look, Minnesota, we protect these things.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.80">We've got about 20% of the world's fresh water.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">These lands protect.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">They're there for a reason.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">They belong to all of us.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">But again, this is when you view housing and you view these things as commodities, like there's a chance to make money here.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">Let's take this federal land and let's sell it to people for that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.14">I think there's better ways to do this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">We've seen it in Minnesota.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">We're able to refurbish some of these houses.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">We're able to make some investments, that gets people in.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">And I'm still on the fact, on this, economist, Senator Vance, you said you don't like the economist, which economists are saying that it is immigrants that's adding to the cost.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">Governor, governor, your time is, your time is up.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">Sorry.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">But, Senator, on that point, I'd like for you to clarify.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.47">There are many contributing factors to high housing costs.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">What evidence do you have that migrants are part of this problem?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.47">Well, there's a Federal Reserve study that we're happy to share after the debate.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">We'll put it up on social media.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">Actually, that really drills down on the connection between increased levels of migration, especially illegal immigration, and higher housing prices.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.59">Now, of course, Margaret, that's not the entire driver of higher housing prices.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">It's also the regulatory regime of Kamala Harris.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.47">Look, we are a country of builders.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">We're a country of doers.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">We're a country of explorers.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.55">But we increasingly have a Federal administration that makes it harder to develop our resources, makes it harder to build things, and wants to throw people in jail for not doing everything exactly as Kamala Harris says that they have to do.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">And what that means is that you have a lot of people who would love to build homes who aren't able to build homes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">I actually agree with Tim Walz.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">We should get out of this idea of housing as a commodity.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.60">But the thing that has most turned housing into a commodity is giving it away to millions upon millions of people who have no legal right to be here.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">What are the federal regulations?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">I deal with this as a Governor.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">You can very quickly reply.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">I'm sorry.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">I get this as a Governor, and I don't necessarily disagree with that, that in some cases, many of those are local, many of them are state.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">I don't know which ones are federal, but I think whenever we talk regulations, people think they can get rid of them.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">I think you want to be able to get out of your house in a fire.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">I think you want to make sure that it's fireproof and those types of things.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">So which are the regulations?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.48">Because the vice president's not responsible for those.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.57">Congress writes those.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">Governor, thank you, gentlemen.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">We have a lot to get through.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">You're passionate about the housing crisis.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">I can tell.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">But Norah?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">Thank you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.69">One of the top problems facing Americans is the high cost of health care.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">Senator Vance, at the last Presidential debate, former President Trump was asked about replacing the Affordable Care act.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">In response, he said, I have concepts of a plan.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">Since then, Senator, you've talked about changing how chronically ill Americans get health insurance.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">Can you explain how that would work?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">And can you guarantee that Americans with pre-existing conditions won't pay more?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">I'll give you two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.55">Well, of course, we're going to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.74">In fact, a lot of my family members have gotten health care, I believe, you know, members of my family actually got private health insurance, at least, for the first time, switched off of Medicaid onto private insurance for the first time, under Donald Trump's leadership.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">And I think that, you know, a lot of people have criticized this "concepts of a plan" remark.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">I think it's very simple common sense.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.64">I think, as Tim Walz knows from twelve years in Congress, you're not going to propose a 900 page bill standing on a debate stage.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">It would bore everybody to tears and it wouldn't actually mean anything because part of this is the give and take of bipartisan negotiation.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.78">Now, when Donald Trump was actually President, and again, he has a record to be proud of, prescription drugs fell in 2018 for the first time in a very long time.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.84">Under Kamala Harris's leadership, prescription drugs are up about 7%.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.86">Under Donald Trump's entire four years, they were up about one and a half percent.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">He introduced pricing transparency.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">Think about healthcare.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">You go into a hospital, you try to buy something, and nobody knows what it actually costs.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">That price transparency will actually give American consumers a little bit more choice and will also drive down costs.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">And we talked about, you know, the reinsurance regulations is what I was talking about.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.65">Look, Donald Trump has said that if we allow states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically ill, but the non chronically ill.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">It's not just a plan.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.72">He actually implemented some of these regulations when he was President of the United States.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">And I think you can make a really good argument that it salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.08">I think this is an important point about President Trump.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">Of course, you don't have to agree with everything that President Trump has ever said or ever done, but when Obamacare was crushing under the weight of its own regulatory burden and healthcare costs, Donald Trump could have destroyed the program.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.75">Instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.12">It's not perfect, of course, and there's so much more that we can do.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.46">But I think that Donald Trump has earned the right to put in place some better healthcare policies.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">He's earned it because he did it successfully the first time.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">Governor.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">All right, here's where being an old guy gives you some history.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.51">I was there at the creation of the ACA, and the reason it was so important is I come from a major healthcare state, home of the Mayo Clinic, home to Medical Alley, 3M, Medtronic, all of those.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">We understand healthcare.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.63">It's why we're ranked first on affordability and accessibility and quality of health care.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.51">And so what I know is under Kamala Harris, more people are covered than they have before.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">Those of you listening, this is critical to you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.45">Now, Donald Trump all of a sudden wants you... go back and remember this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">He ran on, the first thing he was going to do on day one, was to repeal Obamacare.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.82">On day one, he tried to sign an executive order to repeal the ACA.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.74">He signed onto a lawsuit to repeal the ACA, but lost at the Supreme Court.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.48">And he would have repealed the ACA had it not been for the courage of John McCain to save that bill.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">Now fast forward.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">What that means to you is you lose your pre-existing conditions if you're sitting at home and you got asthma, too bad.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">If you're a woman, probably not.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">Broke your foot during football, might kick you out.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.47">Your kids get kicked out when they're 26.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.74">Kamala Harris negotiated drug prices for the first time with Medicare.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.79">We have ten drugs that will come online, the most common ones that'll be there.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">But look, this issue, and when Donald Trump said, "I've got a concept of a plan," it cracked me up as a fourth grade teacher because my kids would have never given me that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">But what Senator Vance just explained might be worse than a concept, because what he explained is pre-Obamacare.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.14">And I'll make this as simple as possible because I have done this for a long time.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">What they're saying is if you're healthy, why should you be paying more?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">So what they're going to do is let insurance companies pick who they insure.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">Because guess what happens?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">You pay your premium.</span> &nbsp;

Vance: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.72">Well, look, we currently have laws and regulations in place, in place right now that protect people with preexisting conditions.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.46">We want to keep those regulations in place, but we also want to make the health insurance marketplace function a little bit better.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">Now, what Governor Walz just said is actually not true.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.72">A lot of what happened and the reason that Obamacare was crushing under its own weight is that a lot of young and healthy people were leaving the exchanges.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.78">Donald Trump actually helped address that problem, and he did so in a way that preserved people's access to coverage who had preexisting conditions.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.53">But again, something that these guys do, is they make a lot of claims about if Donald Trump becomes President, all of these terrible consequences are going to ensue.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.62">But in reality, Donald Trump was President.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.61">Inflation was low, take home pay was higher, and he saved the very program from a Democratic administration that was collapsing and would have collapsed absent his leadership.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.61">He did his job, which is govern in a bipartisan way and get results, not just complain about problems, but actually solve them.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.73">Governor, did enrollment under the Affordable Care Act go up under the Trump Administration?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">It's higher now that we've seen it go up.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">Look, people are using it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">The system works.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">And the question about this of young people or whatever, that's the individual mandate piece of this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.51">And Republicans fought tooth and nail, saying, well, Americans should be free to do this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">Well, then what happens?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D.

&nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.84">There is a childcare crisis in this country, and the United States is one of the very few developed countries in the world without a national paid leave program for new parents.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.62">Governor Walz, you said that if Democrats win both the White House and Congress, this is a day one priority for you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.55">How long should employers be required to pay workers while they are home taking care of their newborns?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">You have two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">Yeah, well, that's negotiable.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">And that's what Congress worked.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.15">But here's what the deal is.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">Americans sitting out there right now, you may work for a big company.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.72">Look, we're home in Minnesota to some of the largest Fortune 500 companies.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">Kamala Harris knows that in California.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.63">Those companies provide paid family medical leave.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">One is, I think they're moral and they think it's a good thing, but it also keeps their employees healthy.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.73">We in Minnesota passed a paid family medical leave.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">You have a child.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">You, and I had to go back to work five days after my kids were born.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">This allows you to stay home a certain amount of time.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">What we know is that gets the child off to a better start.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.16">The family works better.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.32">We stay in their employers.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">We get more consistency in that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">So Kamala Harris has made it a priority.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.71">We implemented it in Minnesota, and we see growth.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">That's how you become a pro-business state.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">But the negotiations on it, and here's the issue, those big companies are able to offer it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">Those of you out there who don't have it, just imagine what happens if you get cancer or your child gets sick.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">We know what happens.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">You end up staying home.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.57">In some places, that means no paycheck, because you've got no protection on that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.78">This is the case of an economy that Donald Trump has set for the wealthiest amongst us.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.67">He's willing to give those tax breaks to the wealthiest, he's willing to say, "Bust those unions up.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">Do whatever."</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">What we're saying is the economy works best when it works for all of us.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">And so a paid family medical leave program, and I will tell you, go to the families or go to the businesses and ask them.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">As far as childcare on this, you have to take it at both the supply and the demand side.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.15">You can't expect the most important people in our lives to take care of our children or our parents, to get paid the least amount of money.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.41">And we have to make it easier for folks to be able to get into that business and then to make sure that folks are able to pay for that.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.57">We were able to do it in Minnesota, and I'm still telling you this, we were listed as the best state.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">We're still in crisis on this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.57">A Federal program of paid family medical leave and help with this will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.30">Governor, your time is up.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">Senator, do you support a national paid leave program?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.55">And if so, for how long should employers be mandated to pay their employees while they are home taking care of their newborn?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">You have two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">Yeah.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">Well, first of all, Margaret, a number of my Republican colleagues and some Democrats, too, have worked on this issue, and I think there is a bipartisan solution here because a lot of us care about this issue.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.26">I mean, look, I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">And it's not just difficult from a policy perspective.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.76">She actually had access to paid family leave because she worked for a bigger company.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.14">But the cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">A lot of young women would like to go back to work immediately.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.18">Some would like to spend a little time home with the kids.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">Some would like to spend longer at home with the kids.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">We should have a family care model that makes choice possible.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">And I think this is a very important substantive difference between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris's approach.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.62">I mean, look, if you look at the Federal programs that we have that support paid family leave right now, the community development block grant, and there's another block grant program that spends a lot of money from the federal government.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">These programs only go to one kind of childcare model.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">Let's say you'd like your church, maybe, to help you out with child care.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.18">Maybe you live in a rural area or an urban area, and you'd like to get together with families in your neighborhood to provide childcare in the way that makes the most sense.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.63">You don't get access to any of these federal monies.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">We want to promote choice in how we deliver family care and how we promote childcare because, look, it is unacceptable.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">And, you know, of course, Tim and I have been on the campaign trail a lot the past seven or eight weeks.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.29">And one of the biggest complaints I hear from young families is people who feel like they don't have options, like they're choosing between going to work or taking care for their kids.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.45">That is an incredible burden to put on American families.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.58">We're the only country that does it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">I think we could do a heck of a lot better.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">Senator, thank you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">You have also said, Senator Vance, many things about the American family.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.84">The Federal Reserve says parents will spend nearly as much on childcare as they do on housing each month.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">So I want to get your thoughts on this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.73">President Trump recently said, as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it's, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kinds of numbers we'll be taking in.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.75">Is President Trump committed to the $5,000 per child tax credit that you have described?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">You have 1 minute.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.52">Well, what President Trump said, Margaret, I just want to defend my running mate here a little bit, is that we're going to be taking in a lot of money by penalizing companies for shipping jobs overseas and penalizing countries who employ slave laborers and then ship their products back into our country and undercut the wages of American workers.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.59">It's the heart of the Donald Trump economic plan.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">Cut taxes for American workers and American families.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.65">Cut taxes for businesses that are hiring and building companies in the United States of America.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.61">But penalize companies and countries that are shipping jobs overseas.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.37">That's the heart of the economic proposal.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.57">And I think what President Trump is saying is that when we bring in this additional revenue with higher economic growth, we're going to be able to provide paid family leave, childcare options that are viable and workable for a lot of American families.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">Can you clarify how that will solve the childcare shortage?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.49">Well, because, as Tim said, a lot of the childcare shortages, we just don't have enough resources going into the multiple people who could be providing family care options.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.38">And we're going to have to, unfortunately, look, we're going to have to spend more money.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.48">We're going to have to induce more people to want to provide child care options for American families because the reason it's so expensive right now is because you've got way too few people providing this very essential service.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">Thank you, Senator.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.69">Governor Walz, your ticket also has some childcare tax credit proposals.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.59">Do you think Congress will agree to the $6,000 credit for newborns and $3,000 credit for children over the age of six, as your campaign has promised?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">Is that realistic?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Tim Walz: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">Well, well, if these members of Congress are listening to anybody, I can tell you, and this is the biggest issue everybody listening tonight knows.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.28">I mean, I'm sure they were shocked to hear it's not that expensive.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.46">And let's be clear whether it's $5000 or $6000, that pays you about three or four months.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.20">Let's be clear of where we're at on this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.52">It's because we got out of an imbalance on this.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">We thought we were going to get by by not paying people.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">I don't think Senator Vance and I are that far apart.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">I'm not opposed to what he's talking about on options.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.39">We've done scholarships, types of things.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.10">I think we need to be open to making the case.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.44">But the issue here is, the question you asked is you're not going to pay for it with these tariffs.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.70">That's just adding another $4,000 on the family and taking less.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.64">So not only do they not get the money to pay for that, they're $4,000 in the hole.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">That's Wharton School.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">That's his alma mater.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.18">And so I think the issue here is those members of Congress, I can't believe they're not here.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.31">When I go to businesses, sure, they'll talk about taxes sometimes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.43">But they will lead with childcare and they will lead with housing, because we know the problem is, especially in a state like Minnesota, we need more workers because our economy is growing, but we need the workforce.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Margaret Brennan: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.24">Governor, thank you.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.17">We need to move on.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">Norah?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">Norah O'Donnell: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.35">Let's talk about the State of Democracy, the top issue for Americans after the economy and inflation.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.71">After the 2020 election, President Trump's campaign and others filed 62 lawsuits contesting the results.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_9 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.84">Judges, including those appointed by President Trump and other Republican Presidents looked at the evidence and said there was no widespread fraud.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.74">The Governors of every state in the nation, Republicans and Democrats, certified the 2020 election results and sent a legal slate of electors to Congress for January 6th.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.59">Senator Vance, you have said you would not have certified the last Presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.55">That has been called unconstitutional and illegal.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.50">Would you again seek to challenge this year's election results, even if every Governor certifies the results?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.23">I'll give you two minutes.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4 style="display: inline">J.D. Vance: &nbsp</h4><span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">Well, Norah, first of all, I think that we're focused on the future.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.34">We need to figure out how to solve the inflation crisis caused by Kamala Harris's policies.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.45">Make housing affordable, make groceries affordable, and that's what we're focused on.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">But I want to answer your question because you did ask it.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_7 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.67">Look, what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.13">And my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.25">And that's all I've said.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.45">And that's all that Donald Trump has said.</span> &nbsp;

&nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.42">Joe Biden became the President.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.50">Donald Trump left the White House.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.40">And now, of course, unfortunately, we have all of the negative policies that have come from the Harris-Biden administration.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.27">I believe that we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country, but unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.19">It is the threat of censorship.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.72">It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">And it's Kamala Harris saying that rather than debate and persuade her fellow Americans, she'd like to censor people who engage in misinformation.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_8 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.70">I think that is a much bigger threat to democracy than anything that we've seen in this country in the last four years, in the last 40 years.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.33">Now I'm really proud, especially given that I was raised by two lifelong blue collar Democrats to have the endorsement of Bobby Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, lifelong leaders in the democratic coalition.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">And of course, they don't agree with me and Donald Trump on every issue.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.36">We don't have to agree on every issue, but we're united behind a basic American First Amendment principle that we ought to debate our differences.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.21">We ought to argue about them.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.22">We ought to try to persuade our fellow Americans.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.53">Kamala Harris is engaged in censorship at an industrial scale.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_6 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.56">She did it during COVID, she's done it over a number of other issues.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="color_class_5 style="display: inline" data-colorclass="0.48">And that, to me, is a much bigger threat to democracy than what Donald Trump said when he said that protesters should peacefully protest on January 6th.</span> &nbsp;
